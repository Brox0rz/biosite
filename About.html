      <h1>About Shani</h1>
      <img src="photos/ShaniPig.jpeg" alt="About Shani" width="600" class="centered-image">
      <p class="lightgreen">Shani Sears (she/they), the co-founder of Sunshine Earth Design, is a passionate advocate for improving 
        the Earth and its soil. Through her small business, she aims to create healthy and natural ecosystems that can 
        coexist harmoniously with humans while promoting food sovereignty for all. With a deep-rooted connection to 
        the Earth as a long-time caretaker, Shani is driven to utilize her extensive knowledge and unwavering commitment 
        to sustainable and regenerative living. When she's not busy digging in the dirt and designing gardens, you can 
        find her singing in her garden sanctuary, dancing barefoot among the flowers, or diving into the refreshing 
        waters of lakes and oceans, seeking the tranquility of swimming and the beauty of waterfalls. <br><br>
        Shani's enthusiasm 
        for sustainable living extends beyond her work. As a passionately vegan individual, she advocates for animal 
        rights and welfare. She believes in fostering a compassionate and cruelty-free world, where all beings are 
        treated with respect and kindness. Shani's dedication to veganism is an integral part of her vision for a 
        sustainable future. In addition to her love for animals and the Earth, Shani envisions a future where she 
        can combine her passion for permaculture and education. Her dream is to establish a permaculture animal 
        sanctuary ecovillage, where rescued animals are given a safe and loving home, and where she can teach children 
        and community members how to grow their own food and care for the Earth. Shani really looks forward to the 
        support and collaboration of like-minded individuals, appreciating any connections, advice, or opportunities 
        that can contribute to her journey. Her vision is inspired by the belief that each individual has the power to 
        bring about positive change. By being the change they wish to see, Shani strives to create a brighter future 
        for our planet, all its inhabitants, and the well-being of animals everywhere.</p>
