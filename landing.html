        <p class="intro">
        Shani Sears (she/they), the co-founder of Sunshine Earth Design, is a passionate advocate for improving the Earth and its soil. 
        Through her small business, she aims to create healthy and natural ecosystems that can coexist harmoniously with humans while promoting food sovereignty for all.
        With a deep-rooted connection to the Earth as a long-time caretaker, Shani is driven to utilize her extensive knowledge and unwavering commitment to sustainable 
        and regenerative living. When she's not busy digging in the dirt and designing gardens, you can find her singing in her garden sanctuary, dancing barefoot among 
        the flowers, or diving into the refreshing waters of lakes and oceans, seeking the tranquility of swimming and the beauty of waterfalls.        
        Shani's enthusiasm for sustainable living extends beyond her work. As a passionately vegan individual, she advocates for animal rights and welfare. 
        She believes in fostering a compassionate and cruelty-free world, where all beings are treated with respect and kindness. Shani's dedication to veganism is an 
        integral part of her vision for a sustainable future.        
        In addition to her love for animals and the Earth, Shani envisions a future where she can combine her passion for permaculture and education. 
        Her dream is to establish a permaculture animal sanctuary ecovillage, where rescued animals are given a safe and loving home, and where she can teach children 
        and community members how to grow their own food and care for the Earth.      
        Shani eagerly looks forward to the support and collaboration of like-minded individuals, appreciating any connections, advice, or opportunities that can contribute to 
        her journey. Her vision is inspired by the belief that each individual has the power to bring about positive change. By being the change they wish to see, Shani strives to 
        create a brighter future for our planet, all its inhabitants, and the well-being of animals everywhere.
